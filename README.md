<b>Vrexium</b> is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/Body-Alhoha/OpenEctasy">OpenEctasy</a>, a lightweight, open source version of the open source version of ðŸª¦ Ectasy<br>

## Injecting
Download `injector.jar` from the [latest version](https://github.com/M1noa/Vrexium/raw/refs/heads/main/injector.jar) and open it (you must have [java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21) installed). Click the `Select` button and select your plugin, then clxick the `Inject` button.
